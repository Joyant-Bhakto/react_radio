## React Radio

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MoritzHorch/react_radio.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MoritzHorch/react_radio)

Hello there (General Kenobi), this React App is just a personal project to experiment with ...

- React
- Semantic UI
- (probably) some various solutions to stream audio like radio stations or files

## Support
As everything is just a simple project to experiment, I can't guarantee a fully functioning app. 
You shouldn't expect my fully attention to issues either. This doesn't mean I wouldn't be happy about people trying to help me improving my coding knowledge - just don't expect anything to being fixed within days :)
